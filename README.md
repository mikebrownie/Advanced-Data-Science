Making the invisible visible, recovering insight and trends, and studying missing information with CSCI 4022

## What is it?

A field sitting between mathmatical statistic and computer science algorthims.

*Practical goals: find valid, useful, understandable, and (possible) unexpected paterns and models.*

## The Scientific Method

1) Hypothesis
2) Observations
3) Analysis
4) Conclusions
5) Refinements

## Learning Goals

1) Utilize Python3 via Jupyter Notebook to clean, munge, visualize and explore data
2) Understand the theory and practice behind distance-based similarity measures, including clustering algorithims in generic metric spaces and similarity measures on graphs.
3) Apply similarity measures in a modern industry setting, including frequesnt itemsets and reccomendation systems.
4) Matrix decomposistions in modern 
5) Implementation of modern bells and whistles, like SQL and MapReduce.
